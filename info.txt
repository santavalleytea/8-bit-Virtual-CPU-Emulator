1. Create CPU Struct
- Virtual CPU needs to store its internal states:
i.e. registers, memory, PC, SP, flags etc.

2. Load program into RAM and Fetching Instructions
- Loads a program (binary) into RAM
- Starts with program counter PC = 0
- Repeats the following loop:
    - fetch instruction at PC
    - decode binary
    - execute
    - move PC forward unless it is a JMP
